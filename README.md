hello, this is kinda an unusual resp but im willing to do this, for the fight and for my friend

## f*ck u mean?
so basicly this person who goes to my school has been really fugly to my friend we wikll call my friend jay and the other person (hacked one) for Liam (thats his actual name but it doesnt matter bc of what i put in this resp)
some of the people in my school know i can hack and to not mess with me but some doesnt and goes a little bit too far, this resp might get me banned from github but im doing this for my friend.
but Liam was the one to go too far. Btw Liam thinks the me and him are firends but thats not the case, im manipulating him.
Liam messed with my friend and spread roomers about jay and then jay told me and i was not happy about what Liam did.
Liam knows i can hack but acts tuff around me like thinks im not gonna do a shit but i can see deep in him that he knows that after this he's completly fucked.
and this week he crossed the line and spread roomers about my friend jay. When i got home it took a few hours for jay to tell me this. I already have a lot of info of this "Liam" so it was not a problem.
i told my friend that i got his info, andress and OS info and thats why im making this resp rn.
all the other files are data leaks of Liam.
that includes:
- OS info
- adress
- parents name
- IP adress
- network info
tho im gonna pull more stuff out of Liam while he still thinks me and him are friends.
if someone ever does something to me or my friend they are gonna pay for it in some way.
this is why you shouldnt mess with people that might be dangerous because in real life im just a whimp but on the internet im a boss.

remember im risking my github rn
download and hack all you can, its free and i advice you to hack it because thats what i want.
put it on the dark web or whatever, that just makes it better.

hope he regrets this
